My solution differs greatly. This is due to two factors.
1. Doing a flexbox exercise I wanted to flex everything. Which makes no sense when it comes to the title.
- I had the right idea about adding a container + subcontainers for graphics and text.
2. However, I forgot about text-align (as has happened before, in a totally different exercise).
   When I finally remembered it, I used it as a fix, only for the items' descriptions.
   Instead of applying it to the whole page, which would have made things much easier from the get-go.
3. Bonus: When declaring a width in pixel, don't forget the px lol
